    # Week 3 - Assignment

    ## Introduction

    We've got some interesting school data that we're working with. In addition to displaying it on the map, we also want to show it in a list. Notice that our project has an element, .sidebar, that contains no content. We are going to fill it with filtering functionality and a list of schools.

    ## Build components with HTML and CSS

    Take a look at the image assignment-screen.png. Add HTML inside of the element <div class="sidebar"></div> and add CSS inside the file css/style.css to recreate this content in the browser. You do not need to create the list of schools dynamically using the dataâ€”just hardcode three schools (in a future assignment, we will generate the list with the same data that we use to generate markers on our map!).

    Start by trying to make it look as much like the image as possible.

    ## Make it look cool

    Try changing the colors or spacing. Make it look a little different. There is no right answer here: just try something and make it your own. Take a look at neat websites on https://www.typewolf.com/ or http://www.awwwards.com/ for color or styling inspiration.
