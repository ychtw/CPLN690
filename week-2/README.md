### Project

We're producing a simple map to help people find health centers in the
Philadelphia area. Our application has two goals:
First, we want to know where the health centers are located within the
zip codes from 19140 to 19149 (inclusive).
* Markers should be made draggable with a custom `Options` object
* All and only markers found within the zip code range from 19140 to
  19149 (inclusive) should appear
* Each marker should have custom content that comes up in a dialog when
  clicked which tells us the location name

Second, we'd like to provide users with the ability to export our data
in a simplified CSV format. We can provide this to them in console printouts.
* On application start, console.log EITHER:
    * An array for the keys and an array for each 'row' OR
    * An array of arrays in which the first sub-array contains keys and
      the rest of the arrays contain the 'rows' of our CSV

#### Extra

Some health centers offer dental services as well. Can you find a way to
give centers that provide dental services a different icon than those
that do not?
