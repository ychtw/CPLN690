# Week 8, Assignment

Create an interactive application using Leaflet Draw and Turf.js. The
application should meet either sets of the requirements below. You should work
with the following dataset: [Cambridge Public Art locations](https://github.com/cambridgegis/cambridgegis_data/blob/master/Landmark/Public_Art/LANDMARK_PublicArt.geojson).

## Variation One:
- The user draws a shape on map
- All points that overlap with the shape should be represented as separate
elements in the sidebar
- When the user clicks on an element in the sidebar, the corresponding point on
the map should become highlighted

## Variation Two:

- The user adds a marker on the map
- The five closest points should be represented as separate elements in the sidebar
- When the user clicks on an element in the sidebar, the corresponding point on
the map should become highlighted
