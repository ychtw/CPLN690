# Lab 1

#### Introduction

We've been using GitHub to turn in assignments. Our process has looked something like this:

  1. Fork the repository, creating your own copy of it
  2. Make changes to the files in the repository on your local machine
  3. Commit changes and sync with the server
  4. Open a pull request

When you open a pull request, you are submitting your changes for consideration. The owner of the repository can decide to accept the pull request, pulling your changes into the project. They can also ask questions about your changes, give feedback or request changes, or reject it.

For this lab, you will work with a partner to start a new repository and go through the entire process of making and pulling in changes. For the instructions below, one person in your group can be PERSON 1 and the other can be PERSON 2.

#### Task 1

- PERSON 1: create a new repository on GitHub with the following requirements
  - Initialize with a README
  - No license
  - No .gitignore
- PERSON 1: add their name to the README
- PERSON 1: commit changes and sync with the server
- These changes should be reflected on the repository on Github.com

#### Task 2

- PERSON 2: fork the repository
- PERSON 2: update README.md with their name
- PERSON 2: commit changes and sync with the server
- PERSON 2: open a pull request from their fork to the repository

#### Task 3

- PERSON 1: review the pull request
- PERSON 1: try to add a comment to a particular line of text in the pull request
- PERSON 1: accept the pull request

#### Task 4

- PERSON 1 and PERSON 2: look at the code base on Github.com. Look at the list of commits; you should see one commit from PERSON 1 and one commit from PERSON 2

#### Task 5

- PERSON 1 and PERSON 2: switch roles and go through Task 1â€“4 again
